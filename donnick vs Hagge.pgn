    {Just aggression, push the pawns to attack the king.}
16.e5 fxe5 
    {I can just take this right? I don't see an issue here. Maybe the 
    knight on e5 might be a bit annoying.
    EDIT: no it isn't, if Nxe5 then Bxg2}

    doesn't seem like an immediate issue.} )
    ( 17...Bf6 18.Rxc5 {This just gives up a pawn, seems unnecessary.} )
